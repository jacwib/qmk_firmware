# Jacwib's preonic keymap.

Swedish, standard-ish keyboard layout, with some extra goodies.

Still rocking the rev1 in 2019!

* Version 1.2:

Added steno mode, mixed some stuff up.

* Version 1.1:

Added PgUp and PgDn keys.

Also added "Mac mode". Unsure if it even works. Might however be able to test soon.

(2019 update: it does work.)

* Version 1.2:

Changed around alt and super keys.

Made "Mac mode" function, and tested it! (It works)
